Storing information using variables
Computers are useful for two purposes: storing information (also known as data) and performing operations on stored data. While working with a programming language such as Python, data is stored in variables. You can think of variables are containers for storing data. The data stored within a variable is called its value. Creating variables in Python is pretty easy, as we've already seen in the previous tutorial.

my_favorite_color = "blue"
my_favorite_color
'blue'
A variable is created using an assignment statement. It begins with the variable's name, followed by the assignment operator = followed by the value to be stored within the variable. Note that the assignment operator = is different from the equality comparison operator ==.

You can also assign values to multiple variables in a single statement by separating the variable names and values with commas.

color1, color2, color3 = "red", "green", "blue"
color1
'red'
color2
'green'
color3
'blue'
You can assign the same value to multiple variables by chaining multiple assignment operations within a single statement.

color4 = color5 = color6 = "magenta"
color4
'magenta'
color5
'magenta'
color6
'magenta'
You can change the value stored within a variable by assigning a new value to it using another assignment statement. Be careful while reassigning variables: when you assign a new value to the variable, the old value is lost and no longer accessible.

my_favorite_color = "red"
my_favorite_color
'red'
While reassigning a variable, you can also use the variable's previous value to compute the new value.

counter = 10
counter = counter + 1
counter
11
The pattern var = var op something (where op is an arithmetic operator like +, -, *, /) is very common, so Python provides a shorthand syntax for it.

counter = 10
# Same as `counter = counter + 4`
counter += 4
counter
14
Variable names can be short (a, x, y, etc.) or descriptive ( my_favorite_color, profit_margin, the_3_musketeers, etc.). However, you must follow these rules while naming Python variables:

A variable's name must start with a letter or the underscore character _. It cannot begin with a number.
A variable name can only contain lowercase (small) or uppercase (capital) letters, digits, or underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _).
Variable names are case-sensitive, i.e., a_variable, A_Variable, and A_VARIABLE are all different variables.
Here are some valid variable names:

a_variable = 23
is_today_Saturday = False
my_favorite_car = "Delorean"
the_3_musketeers = ["Athos", "Porthos", "Aramis"] 
Let's try creating some variables with invalid names. Python prints a syntax error if your variable's name is invalid.

Syntax: The syntax of a programming language refers to the rules that govern the structure of a valid instruction or statement. If a statement does not follow these rules, Python stops execution and informs you that there is a syntax error. You can think of syntax as the rules of grammar for a programming language.

a variable = 23
  File "<ipython-input-20-b4f9daa715a5>", line 1
    a variable = 23
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
is_today_$aturday = False
  File "<ipython-input-21-3785425ca227>", line 1
    is_today_$aturday = False
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
my-favorite-car = "Delorean"
  File "<ipython-input-22-829f5ed5b10b>", line 1
    my-favorite-car = "Delorean"
    ^
SyntaxError: cannot assign to operator
3_musketeers = ["Athos", "Porthos", "Aramis"]
  File "<ipython-input-23-41d8638a15bb>", line 1
    3_musketeers = ["Athos", "Porthos", "Aramis"]
     ^
SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal

Built-in data types in Python
Any data or information stored within a Python variable has a type. You can view the type of data stored within a variable using the type function.

a_variable
23
type(a_variable)
int
is_today_Saturday
False
type(is_today_Saturday)
bool
my_favorite_car
'Delorean'
type(my_favorite_car)
str
the_3_musketeers
['Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis']
type(the_3_musketeers)
list
Python has several built-in data types for storing different kinds of information in variables. Following are some commonly used data types:

Integer
Float
Boolean
None
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary
Integer, float, boolean, None, and string are primitive data types because they represent a single value. Other data types like list, tuple, and dictionary are often called data structures or containers because they hold multiple pieces of data together.

Integer
Integers represent positive or negative whole numbers, from negative infinity to infinity. Note that integers should not include decimal points. Integers have the type int.

current_year = 2020
current_year
2020
type(current_year)
int
Unlike some other programming languages, integers in Python can be arbitrarily large (or small). There's no lowest or highest value for integers, and there's just one int type (as opposed to short, int, long, long long, unsigned int, etc. in C/C++/Java).

a_large_negative_number = -23374038374832934334234317348343
a_large_negative_number
-23374038374832934334234317348343
type(a_large_negative_number)
int
Float
Floats (or floating-point numbers) are numbers with a decimal point. There are no limits on the value or the number of digits before or after the decimal point. Floating-point numbers have the type float.

pi = 3.141592653589793238
pi
3.141592653589793
type(pi)
float
Note that a whole number is treated as a float if written with a decimal point, even though the decimal portion of the number is zero.

a_number = 3.0
a_number
3.0
type(a_number)
float
another_number = 4.
another_number
4.0
type(another_number)
float
Floating point numbers can also be written using the scientific notation with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

one_hundredth = 1e-2
one_hundredth
0.01
type(one_hundredth)
float
avogadro_number = 6.02214076e23
avogadro_number
6.02214076e+23
type(avogadro_number)
float
You can convert floats into integers and vice versa using the float and int functions. The operation of converting one type of value into another is called casting.

float(current_year)
2020.0
float(a_large_negative_number)
-2.3374038374832935e+31
int(pi)
3
int(avogadro_number)
602214075999999987023872
While performing arithmetic operations, integers are automatically converted to floats if any of the operands is a float. Also, the division operator / always returns a float, even if both operands are integers. Use the // operator if you want the result of the division to be an int.

type(45 * 3.0)
float
type(45 * 3)
int
type(10/3)
float
type(10/2)
float
type(10//2)
int
Boolean
Booleans represent one of 2 values: True and False. Booleans have the type bool.

is_today_Sunday = True
is_today_Sunday
True
type(is_today_Saturday)
bool
Booleans are generally the result of a comparison operation, e.g., ==, >=, etc.

cost_of_ice_bag = 1.25
is_ice_bag_expensive = cost_of_ice_bag >= 10
is_ice_bag_expensive
False
type(is_ice_bag_expensive)
bool
Booleans are automatically converted to ints when used in arithmetic operations. True is converted to 1 and False is converted to 0.

5 + False
5
3. + True
4.0
Any value in Python can be converted to a Boolean using the bool function.

Only the following values evaluate to False (they are often called falsy values):

The value False itself
The integer 0
The float 0.0
The empty value None
The empty text ""
The empty list []
The empty tuple ()
The empty dictionary {}
The empty set set()
The empty range range(0)
Everything else evaluates to True (a value that evaluates to True is often called a truthy value).

bool(False)
False
bool(0)
False
bool(0.0)
False
bool(None)
False
bool("")
False
bool([])
False
bool(())
False
bool({})
False
bool(set())
False
bool(range(0))
False
bool(True), bool(1), bool(2.0), bool("hello"), bool([1,2]), bool((2,3)), bool(range(10))
(True, True, True, True, True, True, True)
None
The None type includes a single value None, used to indicate the absence of a value. None has the type NoneType. It is often used to declare a variable whose value may be assigned later.

nothing = None
type(nothing)
NoneType
String
A string is used to represent text (a string of characters) in Python. Strings must be surrounded using quotations (either the single quote ' or the double quote "). Strings have the type string.

today = "Saturday"
today
'Saturday'
type(today)
str
You can use single quotes inside a string written with double quotes, and vice versa.

my_favorite_movie = "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" 
my_favorite_movie
"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"
my_favorite_pun = 'Thanks for explaining the word "many" to me, it means a lot.'
my_favorite_pun
'Thanks for explaining the word "many" to me, it means a lot.'
To use a double quote within a string written with double quotes, escape the inner quotes by prefixing them with the \ character.

another_pun = "The first time I got a universal remote control, I thought to myself \"This changes everything\"."
another_pun
'The first time I got a universal remote control, I thought to myself "This changes everything".'
Strings created using single or double quotes must begin and end on the same line. To create multiline strings, use three single quotes ''' or three double quotes """ to begin and end the string. Line breaks are represented using the newline character \n.

yet_another_pun = '''Son: "Dad, can you tell me what a solar eclipse is?" 
Dad: "No sun."'''
yet_another_pun
'Son: "Dad, can you tell me what a solar eclipse is?" \nDad: "No sun."'
Multiline strings are best displayed using the print function.

print(yet_another_pun)
Son: "Dad, can you tell me what a solar eclipse is?" 
Dad: "No sun."
a_music_pun = """
Two windmills are standing in a field and one asks the other, 
"What kind of music do you like?"  

The other says, 
"I'm a big metal fan."
"""
print(a_music_pun)

Two windmills are standing in a field and one asks the other, 
"What kind of music do you like?"  

The other says, 
"I'm a big metal fan."

You can check the length of a string using the len function.

len(my_favorite_movie)
31
Note that special characters like \n and escaped characters like \" count as a single character, even though they are written and sometimes printed as two characters.

multiline_string = """a
b"""
multiline_string
'a\nb'
len(multiline_string)
3
A string can be converted into a list of characters using list function.

list(multiline_string)
['a', '\n', 'b']
Strings also support several list operations, which are discussed in the next section. We'll look at a couple of examples here.

You can access individual characters within a string using the [] indexing notation. Note the character indices go from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the string.

today = "Saturday"
today[0]
'S'
today[3]
'u'
today[7]
'y'
You can access a part of a string using by providing a start:end range instead of a single index in [].

today[5:8]
'day'
You can also check whether a string contains a some text using the in operator.

'day' in today
True
'Sun' in today
False
Two or more strings can be joined or concatenated using the + operator. Be careful while concatenating strings, sometimes you may need to add a space character " " between words.

full_name = "Derek O'Brien"
greeting = "Hello"
greeting + full_name
"HelloDerek O'Brien"
greeting + " " + full_name + "!" # additional space
"Hello Derek O'Brien!"
Strings in Python have many built-in methods that are used to manipulate them. Let's try out some common string methods.

Methods: Methods are functions associated with data types and are accessed using the . notation e.g. variable_name.method() or "a string".method(). Methods are a powerful technique for associating common operations with values of specific data types.

The .lower(), .upper() and .capitalize() methods are used to change the case of the characters.

today.lower()
'saturday'
"saturday".upper()
'SATURDAY'
"monday".capitalize() # changes first character to uppercase
'Monday'
The .replace method replaces a part of the string with another string. It takes the portion to be replaced and the replacement text as inputs or arguments.

another_day = today.replace("Satur", "Wednes")
another_day
'Wednesday'
Note that replace returns a new string, and the original string is not modified.

today
'Saturday'
The .split method splits a string into a list of strings at every occurrence of provided character(s).

"Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat".split(",")
['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
The .strip method removes whitespace characters from the beginning and end of a string.

a_long_line = "       This is a long line with some space before, after,     and some space in the middle..    "
a_long_line_stripped = a_long_line.strip()
a_long_line_stripped
'This is a long line with some space before, after,     and some space in the middle..'
The .format method combines values of other data types, e.g., integers, floats, booleans, lists, etc. with strings. You can use format to construct output messages for display.

# Input variables
cost_of_ice_bag = 1.25
profit_margin = .2
number_of_bags = 500

# Template for output message
output_template = """If a grocery store sells ice bags at $ {} per bag, with a profit margin of {} %, 
then the total profit it makes by selling {} ice bags is $ {}."""

print(output_template)
If a grocery store sells ice bags at $ {} per bag, with a profit margin of {} %, 
then the total profit it makes by selling {} ice bags is $ {}.
# Inserting values into the string
total_profit = cost_of_ice_bag * profit_margin * number_of_bags
output_message = output_template.format(cost_of_ice_bag, profit_margin*100, number_of_bags, total_profit)

print(output_message)
If a grocery store sells ice bags at $ 1.25 per bag, with a profit margin of 20.0 %, 
then the total profit it makes by selling 500 ice bags is $ 125.0.
Notice how the placeholders {} in the output_template string are replaced with the arguments provided to the .format method.

It is also possible to use the string concatenation operator + to combine strings with other values. However, those values must first be converted to strings using the str function.

"If a grocery store sells ice bags at $ " + cost_of_ice_bag + ", with a profit margin of " + profit_margin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-127-78b7958ec7cc> in <module>
----> 1 "If a grocery store sells ice bags at $ " + cost_of_ice_bag + ", with a profit margin of " + profit_margin

TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "float") to str
"If a grocery store sells ice bags at $ " + str(cost_of_ice_bag) + ", with a profit margin of " + str(profit_margin)
'If a grocery store sells ice bags at $ 1.25, with a profit margin of 0.2'
You can str to convert a value of any data type into a string.

str(23)
'23'
str(23.432)
'23.432'
str(True)
'True'
the_3_musketeers = ["Athos", "Porthos", "Aramis"]
str(the_3_musketeers)
"['Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis']"
Note that all string methods return new values and DO NOT change the existing string. You can find a full list of string methods here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp.

Strings also support the comparison operators == and != for checking whether two strings are equal.

first_name = "John"
first_name == "Doe"
False
first_name == "John"
True
first_name != "Jane"
True
We've looked at the primitive data types in Python. We're now ready to explore non-primitive data structures, also known as containers.

Before continuing, let us run jovian.commit once again to record another snapshot of our notebook.

jovian.commit()

Running jovian.commit multiple times within a notebook records new versions automatically. You will continue to have access to all the previous versions of your notebook, using the versions dropdown on the notebook's Jovian.

List
A list in Python is an ordered collection of values. Lists can hold values of different data types and support operations to add, remove, and change values. Lists have the type list.

To create a list, enclose a sequence of values within square brackets [ and ], separated by commas.

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
type(fruits)
list
Let's try creating a list containing values of different data types, including another list.

a_list = [23, 'hello', None, 3.14, fruits, 3 <= 5]
a_list
[23, 'hello', None, 3.14, ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], True]
empty_list = []
empty_list
[]
To determine the number of values in a list, use the len function. You can use len to determine the number of values in several other data types.

len(fruits)
3
print("Number of fruits:", len(fruits))
Number of fruits: 3
len(a_list)
6
len(empty_list)
0
You can access an element from the list using its index, e.g., fruits[2] returns the element at index 2 within the list fruits. The starting index of a list is 0.

fruits[0]
'apple'
fruits[1]
'banana'
fruits[2]
'cherry'
If you try to access an index equal to or higher than the length of the list, Python returns an IndexError.

fruits[3]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-152-7ceeafd384d7> in <module>
----> 1 fruits[3]

IndexError: list index out of range
fruits[4]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-153-b8c91da6ba3a> in <module>
----> 1 fruits[4]

IndexError: list index out of range
You can use negative indices to access elements from the end of a list, e.g., fruits[-1] returns the last element, fruits[-2] returns the second last element, and so on.

fruits[-1]
'cherry'
fruits[-2]
'banana'
fruits[-3]
'apple'
fruits[-4]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-157-1cb2d66442ee> in <module>
----> 1 fruits[-4]

IndexError: list index out of range
You can also access a range of values from the list. The result is itself a list. Let us look at some examples.

a_list = [23, 'hello', None, 3.14, fruits, 3 <= 5]
a_list
[23, 'hello', None, 3.14, ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], True]
len(a_list)
6
a_list[2:5]
[None, 3.14, ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']]
Note that the range 2:5 includes the element at the start index 2 but does not include the element at the end index 5. So, the result has 3 values (index 2, 3, and 4).

Here are some experiments you should try out (use the empty cells below):

Try setting one or both indices of the range are larger than the size of the list, e.g., a_list[2:10]
Try setting the start index of the range to be larger than the end index, e.g., a_list[12:10]
Try leaving out the start or end index of a range, e.g., a_list[2:] or a_list[:5]
Try using negative indices for the range, e.g., a_list[-2:-5] or a_list[-5:-2] (can you explain the results?)
The flexible and interactive nature of Jupyter notebooks makes them an excellent tool for learning and experimentation. If you are new to Python, you can resolve most questions as soon as they arise simply by typing the code into a cell and executing it. Let your curiosity run wild, discover what Python is capable of and what it isn't!

 
 
 
 
You can also change the value at a specific index within a list using the assignment operation.

fruits
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits[1] = 'blueberry'
fruits
['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
A new value can be added to the end of a list using the append method.

fruits.append('dates')
fruits
['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'dates']
A new value can also be inserted at a specific index using the insert method.

fruits.insert(1, 'banana')
fruits
['apple', 'banana', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'dates']
You can remove a value from a list using the remove method.

fruits.remove('blueberry')
fruits
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'dates']
What happens if a list has multiple instances of the value passed to .remove? Try it out.

 
 
To remove an element from a specific index, use the pop method. The method also returns the removed element.

fruits
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'dates']
fruits.pop(1)
'banana'
fruits
['apple', 'cherry', 'dates']
If no index is provided, the pop method removes the last element of the list.

fruits.pop()
'dates'
fruits
['apple', 'cherry']
You can test whether a list contains a value using the in operator.

'pineapple' in fruits
False
'cherry' in fruits
True
To combine two or more lists, use the + operator. This operation is also called concatenation.

fruits
['apple', 'cherry']
more_fruits = fruits + ['pineapple', 'tomato', 'guava'] + ['dates', 'banana']
more_fruits
['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'tomato', 'guava', 'dates', 'banana']
To create a copy of a list, use the copy method. Modifying the copied list does not affect the original.

more_fruits_copy = more_fruits.copy()
more_fruits_copy
['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'tomato', 'guava', 'dates', 'banana']
# Modify the copy
more_fruits_copy.remove('pineapple')
more_fruits_copy.pop()
more_fruits_copy
['apple', 'cherry', 'tomato', 'guava', 'dates']
# Original list remains unchanged
more_fruits
['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'tomato', 'guava', 'dates', 'banana']
Note that you cannot create a copy of a list by simply creating a new variable using the assignment operator =. The new variable will point to the same list, and any modifications performed using either variable will affect the other.

more_fruits
['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'tomato', 'guava', 'dates', 'banana']
more_fruits_not_a_copy = more_fruits
more_fruits_not_a_copy.remove('pineapple')
more_fruits_not_a_copy.pop()
'banana'
more_fruits_not_a_copy
['apple', 'cherry', 'tomato', 'guava', 'dates']
more_fruits
['apple', 'cherry', 'tomato', 'guava', 'dates']
Just like strings, there are several in-built methods to manipulate a list. However, unlike strings, most list methods modify the original list rather than returning a new one. Check out some common list operations here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp .

Following are some exercises you can try out with list methods (use the blank code cells below):

Reverse the order of elements in a list
Add the elements of one list at the end of another list
Sort a list of strings in alphabetical order
Sort a list of numbers in decreasing order
 
 
 
 
Tuple
A tuple is an ordered collection of values, similar to a list. However, it is not possible to add, remove, or modify values in a tuple. A tuple is created by enclosing values within parentheses ( and ), separated by commas.

Any data structure that cannot be modified after creation is called immutable. You can think of tuples as immutable lists.

Let's try some experiments with tuples.

fruits = ('apple', 'cherry', 'dates')
# check no. of elements
len(fruits)
3
# get an element (positive index)
fruits[0]
'apple'
# get an element (negative index)
fruits[-2]
'cherry'
# check if it contains an element
'dates' in fruits
True
# try to change an element
fruits[0] = 'avocado'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-195-eea1d48cc8b5> in <module>
      1 # try to change an element
----> 2 fruits[0] = 'avocado'

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# try to append an element
fruits.append('blueberry')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-196-e5ea20adaaf8> in <module>
      1 # try to append an element
----> 2 fruits.append('blueberry')

AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'
# try to remove an element
fruits.remove('apple')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

      1 # try to remove an element
----> 2 fruits.remove('apple')

AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'remove'
You can also skip the parantheses ( and ) while creating a tuple. Python automatically converts comma-separated values into a tuple.

the_3_musketeers = 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis'
the_3_musketeers
('Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis')
You can also create a tuple with just one element by typing a comma after it. Just wrapping it with parentheses ( and ) won't make it a tuple.

single_element_tuple = 4,
single_element_tuple
(4,)
another_single_element_tuple = (4,)
another_single_element_tuple
(4,)
not_a_tuple = (4)
not_a_tuple
4
Tuples are often used to create multiple variables with a single statement.

point = (3, 4)
point_x, point_y = point
point_x
3
point_y
4
You can convert a list into a tuple using the tuple function, and vice versa using the list function

tuple(['one', 'two', 'three'])
('one', 'two', 'three')
list(('Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis'))
['Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis']
Tuples have just two built-in methods: count and index. Can you figure out what they do? While you look could look for documentation and examples online, there's an easier way to check a method's documentation, using the help function.

a_tuple = 23, "hello", False, None, 23, 37, "hello"
help(a_tuple.count)
Help on built-in function count:

count(value, /) method of builtins.tuple instance
    Return number of occurrences of value.

Within a Jupyter notebook, you can also start a code cell with ? and type the name of a function or method. When you execute this cell, you will see the function/method's documentation in a pop-up window.

?a_tuple.index
Try using count and index with a_tuple in the code cells below.

 
 
Dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item stored in a dictionary has a key and value. You can use a key to retrieve the corresponding value from the dictionary. Dictionaries have the type dict.

Dictionaries are often used to store many pieces of information e.g. details about a person, in a single variable. Dictionaries are created by enclosing key-value pairs within braces or curly brackets { and }.

person1 = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'sex': 'Male',
    'age': 32,
    'married': True
}
person1
{'name': 'John Doe', 'sex': 'Male', 'age': 32, 'married': True}
Dictionaries can also be created using the dict function.

person2 = dict(name='Jane Judy', sex='Female', age=28, married=False)
person2
{'name': 'Jane Judy', 'sex': 'Female', 'age': 28, 'married': False}
type(person1)
dict
Keys can be used to access values using square brackets [ and ].

person1['name']
'John Doe'
person1['married']
True
person2['name']
'Jane Judy'
If a key isn't present in the dictionary, then a KeyError is thrown.

person1['address']
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-223-f2b8bd2476d4> in <module>
----> 1 person1['address']

KeyError: 'address'
You can also use the get method to access the value associated with a key.

person2.get("name")
'Jane Judy'
The get method also accepts a default value, returned if the key is not present in the dictionary.

person2.get("address", "Unknown")
'Unknown'
You can check whether a key is present in a dictionary using the in operator.

'name' in person1
True
'address' in person1
False
You can change the value associated with a key using the assignment operator.

person2['married']
False
person2['married'] = True
person2['married']
True
The assignment operator can also be used to add new key-value pairs to the dictionary.

person1
{'name': 'John Doe', 'sex': 'Male', 'age': 32, 'married': True}
person1['address'] = '1, Penny Lane'
person1
{'name': 'John Doe',
 'sex': 'Male',
 'age': 32,
 'married': True,
 'address': '1, Penny Lane'}
To remove a key and the associated value from a dictionary, use the pop method.

person1.pop('address')
'1, Penny Lane'
person1
{'name': 'John Doe', 'sex': 'Male', 'age': 32, 'married': True}
Dictionaries also provide methods to view the list of keys, values, or key-value pairs inside it.

person1.keys()
dict_keys(['name', 'sex', 'age', 'married'])
person1.values()
dict_values(['John Doe', 'Male', 32, True])
person1.items()
dict_items([('name', 'John Doe'), ('sex', 'Male'), ('age', 32), ('married', True)])
person1.items()[1]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-239-b9fb361f2a9e> in <module>
----> 1 person1.items()[1]

TypeError: 'dict_items' object is not subscriptable
The results of keys, values, and items look like lists. However, they don't support the indexing operator [] for retrieving elements.

Can you figure out how to access an element at a specific index from these results? Try it below. Hint: Use the list function

 
 
Dictionaries provide many other methods. You can learn more about them here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp .

Here are some experiments you can try out with dictionaries (use the empty cells below):

What happens if you use the same key multiple times while creating a dictionary?
How can you create a copy of a dictionary (modifying the copy should not change the original)?
Can the value associated with a key itself be a dictionary?
How can you add the key-value pairs from one dictionary into another dictionary? Hint: See the update method.
Can the dictionary's keys be something other than a string, e.g., a number, boolean, list, etc.?
